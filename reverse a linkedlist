Sure! The code you provided is an implementation of an iterative method to reverse a linked list. The idea is to use three pointers: `current`, `prev`, and `next` to keep track of nodes and update the links between them in reverse order.

Let's take an example to understand how this works. Suppose we have a linked list with the following elements: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL`. The goal is to reverse the linked list so that it becomes `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL`.

Initially, the three pointers are set as follows:
- `prev` is set to `None`
- `current` is set to the head of the linked list, which is `1` in this case
- `next` is set to the next node of `current`, which is `2`

Now, we enter the while loop, which runs until `current` is not `None`. In each iteration of the loop, the following steps are performed:
1. The next node is stored in the `next` pointer: `next = current.next`
2. The next pointer of the current node is updated to point to the previous node: `current.next = prev`
3. The previous and current pointers are updated for the next iteration: `prev = current` and `current = next`

After the first iteration, the linked list becomes: `None <- 1 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL`, with `prev` pointing to `1`, and both `current` and `next` pointing to `2`.

After the second iteration, it becomes: `None <- 1 <- 2 3 -> 4 -> NULL`, with `prev` pointing to `2`, and both `current` and `next` pointing to `3`.

After the third iteration, it becomes: `None <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 4 -> NULL`, with `prev` pointing to `3`, and both `current` and `next` pointing to `4`.

After the fourth and final iteration, it becomes: `None <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4 NULL`, with all three pointers pointing to None.

At this point, the while loop terminates, and we return the value of the prev pointer, which points to the head of the reversed linked list.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how this code works! Let me know if you have any further questions. ðŸ˜Š
