This code is a Python implementation of a solution to a problem where the goal is to make all rows and columns of a square matrix have the same sum with the minimum number of operations. In each operation, the value of any cell of the matrix can be incremented by any positive integer.

Let's take an example to understand how this code works. Consider the following 3x3 matrix:

```
4 5 6
1 2 3
7 8 9
```

The sum of each row and column is as follows:

```
sumRow = [15, 6, 24]
sumCol = [12, 15, 18]
```

The maximum sum value among rows and columns is `maxSum = 24`. The goal is to make all rows and columns have this sum value.

The code starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to `0`. These pointers keep track of the current row and column being processed. In each iteration of the while loop, the code calculates the minimum increment required in either row `i` or column `j` as `diff = min(maxSum - sumRow[i], maxSum - sumCol[j])`. This value is added to the corresponding cell `matrix[i][j]`, as well as to `sumRow[i]` and `sumCol[j]`. The result variable `count` is also incremented by this value.

In our example, in the first iteration, we have `i = j = 0`, so `diff = min(24 - 15, 24 - 12) = 9`. This value is added to `matrix[0][0]`, `sumRow[0]`, and `sumCol[0]`, so we have:

```
matrix = [[13, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9]]
sumRow = [24, 6, 24]
sumCol = [21, 15, 18]
count = 9
```

Since `sumRow[0]` is now equal to `maxSum`, the row pointer is incremented (`i += 1`). The column pointer remains unchanged since `sumCol[0]` is not yet equal to `maxSum`.

In the next iteration, we have `i = 1` and `j = 0`, so `diff = min(24 - 6, 24 -21) =3`. This value is added to `matrix[1][0]`, `sumRow[1]`, and `sumCol[0]`, so we have:

```
matrix = [[13,5,6],[4,2,3],[7,8,9]]
sumRow = [24,9,24]
sumCol = [24,15,18]
count =12
```

Since both `sumRow[1]` and `sumCol[0]` are now equal to maxSum , both row and column pointers are incremented (`i +=1` and `j +=1`). The process continues until all rows and columns have the same sum value.

After all iterations are completed ,the final matrix will be:
```
matrix=[[13 ,5 ,6],[4 ,11 ,9],[7 ,8 ,9]]
```
and the minimum number of operations required to achieve this result is returned by the function as count=12.
